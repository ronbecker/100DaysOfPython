# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a program to scrape top entries of a subreddit using PRAW.

**Thoughts:** It wasn't nearly as complicated as many people's writing made it look. The hardest part was looking through the overly complicated writing some people had on it.
