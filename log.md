# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Created a program to scrape top entries of a subreddit using PRAW.

**Thoughts:** It wasn't nearly as complicated as many people's writing made it look. The hardest part was looking through the overly complicated writing some people had on it.

### Day 2: January 14, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Created a GUI with PyQt5 for my CleanJaro program/script.

**Thoughts:** It was kind of a pain to find any central or current docs. It was also hard to find answers to a few of my questions. But, all in all it worked fiarly well, and easy. I still need to work on the `sudo` stuff, and making it not so basic and ugly.

### Day 3: January 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on `journ` - command line journal

**Thoughts:** I was studying when I realized I was using a lot of `+` to format strings in situations I didn't need to. So I took the opportunity to clean it up a little, and rewrite some comments.

### Day 4: January 16, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Began work on GLORP. Mostly built an intro outline, and tried to work on planning out programs before I start writing them. Which is kind of harder than it sounds.

**Thoughts:** I need to work on writing pseudo code, and planning out projects. That's not exactly a strong point of mine.

### Day 5: January 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on GLORP some more. I actually started from scratch.

**Thoughts:** Most of my time was spent playing with loops, and switching between them. Loops are one of those things that aren't a difficult concept, but they like to screw with me, apparently.
