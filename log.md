# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Created a program to scrape top entries of a subreddit using PRAW.

**Thoughts:** It wasn't nearly as complicated as many people's writing made it look. The hardest part was looking through the overly complicated writing some people had on it.

### Day 2: January 14, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Created a GUI with PyQt5 for my CleanJaro program/script.

**Thoughts:** It was kind of a pain to find any central or current docs. It was also hard to find answers to a few of my questions. But, all in all it worked fiarly well, and easy. I still need to work on the `sudo` stuff, and making it not so basic and ugly.
